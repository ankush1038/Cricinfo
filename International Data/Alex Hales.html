    <b>Alexander Daniel Hales</b><p>(born 3 January 1989) is an English cricketer. He is a right-handed opening batter who currently plays for Nottinghamshire and the England cricket team in white ball, limited overs formats. He made his One Day International debut against India in August 2014 and his Test cricket debut against South Africa in December 2015. Hales is the first English batter to score a T20I century, and has the highest individual score of an English batter in the format with his 116 not out against Sri Lanka in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. He is also the first batter to be dismissed for 99 in an ODI and a T20I.[1] Hales was a key member of the England team that won the 2022 T20 World Cup.</p>
    <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
    <p>Hales first came to national attention in 2005 when, as a sixteen-year-old, he hit 55 off a single over (three no-balls, eight sixes, one four) in a Cricket Idol T20 tournament at Lords.[3] Ironically, he had been picked for his fast bowling ability.

        Hales first represented Buckinghamshire in Minor Counties cricket during the 2006 season, and played for MCC Young Cricketers in the Second XI Championship of 2007. He then impressed whilst trialling with Nottinghamshire in 2007, scoring 218 in only his second appearance for the county, following it up with a hundred and two 95s. Notts offered him a two-year contract until the end of the 2009 season. He made his List A debut in a rain-affected match against Leicestershire in May 2008 and his first-class debut against Somerset in September 2008. During the 2009 season, after an impressive start, he signed a new two-year contract extension.[4] On 29 August 2009, Alex hit the top score in the Pro40 2009, 150 off 102 balls for Nottinghamshire against Worcestershire at Trent Bridge.[5]
        
        In July 2011, Hales made a century for Nottinghamshire in the county championship, a score that, according to Cricinfo marked him as "beginning to warrant the attention of the England selectors": it was the second century of his first-class career.[6] He went on to make 184.[7]
        
        In May 2015, Hales hit six consecutive sixes across two overs on the opening day of the NatWest t20 Blast in his 86 not out against Birmingham.[8]
        
        On 5 August 2017, Hales hit 95 off 30 balls against Durham in the T-20 Blast competition.</p>
    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>Hales represented England U19s in the summer of 2008 in a series of youth Test matches and ODIs against a touring New Zealand U19's, enjoying a successful time averaging 50 in the Tests and over 30 in the ODIs, including 3 half centuries. After just one season on the county circuit he was named in an England Performance Programme squad in the 09/10 winter. In the 2011 summer he was selected for the England Lions against Sri Lanka and was chosen for all the matches.</p>
    <p>In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport commentator Jonathan Agnew stated that Hales' technique was simply too fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump and playing with a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales could get away with this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack.[15] In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England went on to win the game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2–1.

        However, in the ODI series, Hales returned to form in spectacular style. He scored 4 consecutive fifties and a century to garner Man of the Series. In the first ODI, Hales scored 57 off just 47 balls to put behind the poor Test series. He then went on to score 99 in the second ODI falling just short of his second ODI century. He continued this great form in the third ODI scoring 65 off 73 balls in a losing effort. In the fourth ODI, he scored yet another half-century scoring 50 off 56 balls in another losing effort. In the final ODI, he finally scored his second and well-deserved ODI century, scoring 112 off 128 balls finishing the series with 383 runs overall and the series highest run-scorer.
        
        In the T20 series Hales scored 27 in the first game which England lost, before making a score of 16 in England's final match before the T20 World Cup, in which England were comprehensively beaten by nine wickets.</p>
    <p>Hales retained his place in the test team for the Sri Lanka series, but after much debate by the selectors. He repaid their faith in the first test at Headingley by scoring 86, and sharing a century partnership with Jonny Bairstow when England were in trouble. England went on to win the match by an innings and 88 runs. In the first innings of the second test he again gave himself a good start of 83, but failed to reach his first Test century. He was out for just eleven in the second innings as England secured a nine wicket victory. In the third and final test at Lord's, Hales scored just 18 runs in the first innings, but made a brilliant 94 in the second innings, and was dismissed lbw by Angelo Mathews just six runs short of a place on the honours board. The third match ended in a draw, with England winning the series 2–0.

        Hales made just 4 in the first ODI against Sri Lanka, as the match ended in a tie, with both teams posting 286. In the second match he made 133 not out and was involved in a record breaking partnership with Jason Roy as England won by ten wickets after reaching 256/0. In the third match he was out for a duck in a rain affected match, and did not bat in the fourth match which England won, due to injury. The injury ruled him out of the final match of the series, which England won to take the series 3–0.</p>
        <p>Hales was out for six in the first innings in the first Test against Pakistan, and then made 16 in the second innings as England lost by 75 runs. England won the second Test, although Hales only scored 34 runs in the match. After scoring 17 in the first innings of the third Test, Hales scored 54 in the second innings to help England turn the game around and win by 141 runs. Hales again struggled in the final Test, scoring just six in England's first innings as they were dismissed for 328 and just 12 in the second innings, as England suffered a ten-wicket defeat and drew the series, 2–2. Hales made scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs as England went 2-0 up in the series. In the third ODI Hales achieved the highest ever individual ODI score posting 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan[16] on his home soil at Trent Bridge. The record was previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' ton helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game with England posting 444–3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006[17] against the Dutch at Amstelveen. England won the match by 169 runs as well to seal the series.[18] In the fourth ODI Hales made eight as England chased down Pakistan's target of 248 to go 4–0 up in the series. In the final match, Hales could only manage 23 as England lost their first game of the series, with it finishing 4–1. Hales top-scored for England with 37 in the only T20I between the two sides, but England lost by nine wickets.</p>
        <p>In September 2022, Hales was called back to the English T20 squad for the T20 World Cup, as a late replacement for the injured Jonny Bairstow.[26] After a couple of middling scores in the first two games, Hales hit a good run of form alongside the batting with his captain, Jos Buttler. The pair followed partnerships of 81 and 75 against New Zealand and Sri Lanka with a record opening-partnership of 170 in the semi-final against India. Hales hit 86 not-out, winning the Man of the Match award and saw his team into the final.[27] England went on to win the match, and hence their second T20 World Cup, though Hales made only a single.</p>
